## Development

```
barn run dev

```
ls srv/* | entr -r barn run srv/server.ts
```

## Todo

- walk /isocalc/ from e.g. st pancras to find every accessible h3 in europe and then paint that on the map somehow
    - done, but now need to work out some quick way of using that

- pick random h3s within that area as start/stops

- think about different game modes other than just race: tag? relay? 

- trophies? most modes of transport? highest max speed? most departures? opposites of that?

- improve lobby screen

- think about how to store route history in a human-readable way

- fix nginx root

- switch to / make fahrtle edge list
